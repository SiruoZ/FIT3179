        <h1>World GDP & Debt ratio</h1>
        <p>As the world moves from the industrial age to the digital age and humanity's standard of living skyrockets, so does the productivity of the people. In turn, the economic progression of nations embracing these revolutions dwarf those who stand by idle.
        <br><br>Many innovations allowed us to sustain a living standard that kings from just a century ago would not be able to dream of. However, as the world moves at break-neck speed, the resources needed to keep up with the speed of growth is immense. Thus, debt is required to supplement current growth in hopes that in the future, produce is able to cover all the debt incurred.</p>

            <h2>World GDP</h2>
            <p>Here, we take a look at the overall growth in produce of the global economy. The rate of growth would have been drastic pre-1960, however, the data-set did not have any older data points available. 
              <br><br>As we can see, the post-war economic boom was in full swing from 1960s, to 1980s, where there was the energy crisis caused by the Iranian Revolution. This caused oil prices to rise sharply causing a global recession. 
              <br><br>Following that, the advent of the digital age caused the world’s productivity to almost double. This can be seen at the start of 2000s, where the global GDP almost doubled. However, the sub-prime mortgage crisis in 2008 saw the global GDP drop significantly for the first time. However, the technology boom happened not long after and we can still see the impact of the growth till 2019, before COVID-19 hit.</p>

            <p>The map here shows the global economy’s exponential growth from 1960. The darker shade of green, the bigger the country’s GDP. 
            <br><br>Some data points were not available, and defaults to 0. 
            <br><br>As we observe the world’s economic boom from the digital era, we should keep in mind the costs of embracing debt and capitalism in the next section.</p>

            <h2>Total Global Government Debt</h2>
            <p>Here, we take a look at the total debt central governing bodies incurred from 1990 to 2018. As economies boom, so does the amount of debt people take on. This is due to the fact that there are ample opportunities in the market with plenty of space to grow. By taking on debt, people can capitalize on the market’s availabilities, improving everyone’s standard of living. However, growth is not a given, and eventually productivity grows stagnant. One such instance can be seen in the 2000s due to the dot com bubble crash.
            <br><br>(Note that there was no data available pre-1990s, and the debt is calculated from the available country’s debt to GDP percentage as well as each countries’ GDP.)
            <br><br>Hence why the global debt dropped significantly. It is unclear why GDP did not fall around the year 2000 in the first chart, but the fall in GDP would have accounted for the drop in the chart.
            <br><br>The next sharp rise in government debt would occur around 2007, when governments where forced to bail out large banks and companies due to the amount of risk they took on as debt when the economy boomed. Spending more than you earn so that you can produce more is a great model for capitalism, but not saving for unforeseen circumstances will have big implications for the future.

            <h2>Map of Government Debt</h2>
            <p>The map here shows each countries’ debt to GDP % from 1990 to 2018. The darker shade of red, the more debt incurred. 
            <br><br>We can see the United States taking on significantly more debt to save companies from collapsing between 2005 and 2010.
            <br><br>Also, in 2018, the United States joins the list of countries which has incurred more debt than their GDP. This includes Japan and Greece, with 238% and 174% debt to GDP respectively. Both governments took on debt to stop economic collapse due to financial mismanagement during their respective “golden years”.
            <br><br>These countries are in a precarious situation where the government’s income might not be able to pay even the interest incurred from the debt.</p>
